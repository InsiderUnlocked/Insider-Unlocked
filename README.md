# Introduction
The purpose of Insider Unlocked is dissemination to the general public. Just this year Insider and many other news organizations have identified at least 50 members of congress whoâ€™ve failed to report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, AKA as the Stock Act. We hope to build a platform that takes the publicly available information regarding what assets congress are purchasing or selling, and format it in a manner that is much better then the original PDF source we retrieve it in. By doing this we envision us battling the wrongdoings of insider trading within the government and creating an equal playing field for all investors.
